Research experience
-------------------

Sep. 2012 - Mar. 2017
:   **Research and Teaching Assistant (PhD Student)
    at Université Grenoble Alpes -- Inria (Grenoble, France)**
    
    * Led a theoretical and experimental study of resource allocations in bacterium *E. coli*

    * Used Control Theory principles to show that unexpected resource allocation behaviors can be
    predicted simply by assuming that bacteria optimize growth (published in Plos Comp. Biol.)

    * Engineered and monitored cells with fluorescent ribosomes using microplate reader, microscope and
    a microfluidic device

Feb.-Jun. 2012
:   **Research Assistant (Intern)
    at Inria (Grenoble, France)**

    * Reviewed and implemented state-of-the-art methods of sensitivity analysis on a complex
    model of the gene expression machinery in bacterium *E. coli*

    * Developed a brand-new dynamical method of global sensitivity analysis

    * Helped to identify key parameters driving the model dynamics and reduce its complexity

Feb.-Jun. 2011
:   **Research Assistant (Intern)
    at University of Cambridge -- DAMTP (Cambridge, United Kingdom)**

    * Led a theoretical study on the evolution towards multicellularity on microalgae

    * Developed a model of phosphate uptake and growth on Volvocales

    * Explored the role in phosphate storage of the extracellular matrix, especially
    in changing environments

Jun.-Jul. 2010
:   **Research Assistant (Intern)
    at École Normale Supérieure (Paris, France)**

    * Analyzed time-series fluorescence data of oscillating yeast cells suspensions
    subject to periodic forcing

    * Modified an existing mathematical model based on Hopf bifurcation to recreate the observed
    dynamics

    * Did not identified any chaotic behavior even when an irrational forcing was applied
    to the cells (published in Journal of Computational Interdisciplinary Sciences)

Teaching experience
-------------------

Sept. 2013-Aug. 2016
:   **Teaching assistant**; Université Grenoble Alpes (Grenoble, France), 229H

    * **Bioinformatics: from genome analysis to modelling (BSc)**  
*This introductory course was taught to 2nd-year students in collaboration with
Dr. Thierry Gautier.
I was in charge of the part about modelling, which means I was responsible for choosing 
the content, designing and teaching the lectures, tutorials, and practical exercices,
but also designing the final exam and grading.*

    * **Population genetics, conservation biology, biodiversity and evolution (BSc and MSc)**  
*These different courses were taught from 2nd-year to 4th-year students.
I mostly managed tutorials, helped to design final exams and graded.*

    * **Procaryotic genetics and microbiology (BSc)**  
*This course was taught to 2nd-year students.
I managed tutorials, helped to manage practical exercices at the bench, and graded.*

    * **Modeling and simulation of genetic regulatory networks (MSc)**  
*This course was taught to 5th-year students outside of my regular teaching service.
It was organized for students of École Normale Supérieure, and taught in collaboration
with Dr. Hidde de Jong.
I helped to choose the content, teach the lectures and manage the practical exercices
at the computer.
I also helped to design and grad the final exam on this part.*
