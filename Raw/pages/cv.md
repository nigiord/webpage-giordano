Research experience
-------------------

Sep. 2012 - Mar. 2017
:   **Research and teaching assistant**; PhD student at Université Grenoble Alpes (Grenoble, France)

    Project: *Microbial growth control in changing environments:
    Theoretical and experimental study of resource allocation in Escherichia coli*

*I designed and developed this project that took place in project-team
[Ibis](https://team.inria.fr/ibis/) (Inria Grenoble -- Rhône-Alpes) and
team [BIOP](http://www-liphy.ujf-grenoble.fr/Introduction-627) (Laboratoire
Interdisciplinaire de Physique, Université Grenoble Alpes)
with the help of my PhD advisors Dr. Hidde de Jong and Pr. Johannes Geiselmann.
It coupled **theoretical** and **experimental** approaches on the question of resource
allocation in the bacteria Escherichia coli.
Using **control theory**, I formulated bacterial growth as an optimisation problem and showed that
you can make unexpected predictions from the sole principle of growth maximization.
I experimentally tested these predictions by **building a strain** with fluorescent ribosomes
and monitoring it in a **microfluidic device**.
This work was done in collaboration with several experimentalists and control theorists,
and has produced one publication and several communications in international conferences.*

Feb.-Jun. 2012
:   **Research assistant**; Intern at Inria Grenoble -- Rhône-Alpes (Grenoble, France)
    
    Project: *Study and development of sensitivity analysis techniques for a complex
    model of the gene expression machinery in Escherichia coli.*

*I reviewed and implemented state-of-the-art methods of **sensitivity analysis** on
a complex model of the gene expression machinery in the bacteria Escherichia coli.
I also developed a brand-new dynamical method of global sensitivy analysis which helped
to identify the key parameters driving the model dynamics and reduce its complexity.
This work was supervized by Dr. Delphine Ropers and Dr. Hidde de Jong.*

Feb.-Jun. 2011
:   **Research assistant**; Intern at University of Cambridge, Department of Applied Mathematics
and Theoretical Physics (Cambridge, United Kingdom)

    Project: *Theory for the Evolution of Germ-Soma Differentiation on the Volvocales*

*I designed and developed this short project that took place in
[Goldstein lab](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/) under supervision
of Pr. Raymond E. Goldstein.
I formulated a **mathematical model** of the extracellular matrix to explore its role
during the **evolution of microalgae** in changing environments.*

Jun.-Jul. 2010
:   **Research assistant**; Intern at École Normale Supérieure (Paris, France)

    Project: *Dynamical responses of oscillating yeast cells suspensions to periodic forcing.*

*I analysed **time-series fluorescence data** using several methods of **signal processing**
in order to caracterize the presence of chaotic behaviors.
I also adapted an existing implementation of a mathematical model based on **Hopf bifurcation**.
This short project has produced one publication.*

Teaching experience
-------------------

Sept. 2013-Aug. 2016
:   **Teaching assistant**; Université Grenoble Alpes (Grenoble, France), 229H

    * **Bioinformatics: from genome analysis to modelling (BSc)**  
*This introductory course was taught to 2nd-year students in collaboration with
Dr. Thierry Gautier.
I was in charge of the part about modelling, which means I was responsible for choosing 
the content, designing and teaching the lectures, tutorials, and practical exercices,
but also designing the final exam and grading.*

    * **Population genetics, conservation biology, biodiversity and evolution (BSc and MSc)**  
*These different courses were taught from 2nd-year to 4th-year students.
I mostly managed tutorials, helped to design final exams and graded.*

    * **Procaryotic genetics and microbiology (BSc)**  
*This course was taught to 2nd-year students.
I managed tutorials, helped to manage practical exercices at the bench, and graded.*

    * **Modeling and simulation of genetic regulatory networks (MSc)**  
*This course was taught to 5th-year students outside of my regular teaching service.
It was organized for students of École Normale Supérieure, and taught in collaboration
with Dr. Hidde de Jong.
I helped to choose the content, teach the lectures and manage the practical exercices
at the computer.
I also helped to design and grad the final exam on this part.*

Technical skills
------

** Computer skills **

For the last years, I've been using **Python**, **Git**, and **Unix/shell scripting** daily.
But I used several langages during my career (**Matlab/Octave**, **R**, **PHP**, **SQL**,
**HTML/CSS**).
I'm also curious about more recent langages (**Julia**, **Ruby**, **Rust**) but did not find 
any big project to make with them yet.


** Mathematical skills **

I am proficient into **data analysis** and **modelling**.
I manipulate **linear and non-linear dynamical systems** daily.
I have been in touch with **time-series analysis** (signal processing),
**image analysis**, **sensitivity analysis**, and more recently **Kalman filtering**,
**variational calculus** and **optimal control theory**.
I am also educated into several other domains
(**statistics**, **graph theory**, **molecular modeling**, ...) and curious about machine learning
(especially deep-learning).

** Laboratory skills **

During my PhD, I learned and applied **general synthetic biology techniques** (**culturing**,
**cloning**,
**chromosomic modications**, ...) and had to manipulate myself several instruments
(**microplate reader**, **microscope**, **microfluidic device**).

Extracurricular activities
--------------------------

I like indoor and outdoor climbing (~ 6B french quotation).
I'm a regular author on [bioinfo-fr.net](https://bioinfo-fr.net/),
a communautary french blog intended for young bioinformaticians.
I'm also an advocate for the open-source and libre cultures.
