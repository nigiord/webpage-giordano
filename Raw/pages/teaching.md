Most of my teaching experiences were during my PhD when I was a Teaching Assistant at Université Grenoble Alpes.
During that period, I taught a total of 229 hours over 3 years, and engaged in many different activities from tutorials to organizing lectures.

- **Bioinformatics: from genome analysis to modeling (BSc)**  
*This introductory course was taught to 2nd-year students in collaboration with
Dr. Thierry Gautier.
I was in charge of the part about modeling, which means I was responsible for choosing 
the content, designing and teaching the lectures, tutorials, and practical exercices,
but also designing the final exam and grading.*

- **Population genetics, conservation biology, biodiversity and evolution (BSc and MSc)**  
*These different courses were taught from 2nd-year to 4th-year students in collaboration with Dr. Éric Bazin.
I mostly supervized tutorials and helped to design and grade the final exams.*

- **Prokaryotic genetics and microbiology (BSc)**  
*This course was taught to 2nd-year students.
I supervized tutorials and practical exercices at the bench.*

- **Modeling and simulation of genetic regulatory networks (MSc)**  
*This course was taught to 5th-year students.
It was organized for students of École Normale Supérieure, and taught in collaboration
with Dr. Hidde de Jong.
I helped to choose the content, teach the lectures and supervize the practical exercices.
I also helped to design and grad the final exam.*
