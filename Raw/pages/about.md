I am a Computational Systems Biologist who tries to understand how microbial communities behave in their environment.

I am currently a Research/Data Scientist at [Integrative Phenomics](https://integrative-phenomics.com/), a French start-up that wants to provide science-based personnalized nutritional recommendations.
I work on the [Metabolic Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_network_modelling) of gut microbial communities, trying to understand and predict how they react to a change of diet through the combination of clinical and real-life data.

Previously, I worked on [Microbial Ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbial_ecology) as a Postdoc in COMBI team at [Laboratory of Digital Sciences of Nantes](https://www.ls2n.fr/?lang=en) (LS2N, CNRS UMR 6004).
My work mostly revolved around Metagenomics, NGS data analysis and Metabolic Modeling of microbial communities in the global ocean, using data from [Tara Oceans](https://oceans.taraexpeditions.org/en/).
During my PhD thesis, I was a Research and Teaching Assistant at [Inria](https://team.inria.fr/ibis/) &
[Université Grenoble Alpes](http://www-liphy.ujf-grenoble.fr/Introduction-627?lang=en), working on microbial growth laws of resource allocation in changing environments, using a combination of [Control Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory) and [Synthetic Biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biology).
I also worked in Theoretical Physics ([Goldstein lab](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/), University of Cambridge, UK) and Eco-Evolutionary Mathematics (with [Silvia de Monte](http://www.biologie.ens.fr/eceem/demonte.html), Ecole Normale Supérieure, FR) during several interships.

Overall, my scientific interests include maths, biology, and computer sciences.
My favorite Linux distribution is [Debian Sid](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable). 
My favorite keyboard layout is [BÉPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%89PO).
I am a free software and data privacy advocate. I support [\[π\] La Quadrature du Net](https://www.laquadrature.net/).
I like rock climbing and bouldering, that I try to practice indoor and outdoor (even though the latter was easier in the French Alpes).
