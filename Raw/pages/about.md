I am a Computational Systems Biologist.

I am currently a Postdoc in COMBI team at the [Laboratory of Digital Sciences of Nantes](https://www.ls2n.fr/?lang=en) (LS2N, CNRS UMR 6004), working on Microbial Systems Ecology.
My work mostly revolves around metagenomics, NGS data analysis and metabolic modeling of microbial communities in the global ocean.

During my PhD thesis, I was a Research and Teaching Assistant at [Inria](https://team.inria.fr/ibis/) &
[Université Grenoble Alpes](http://www-liphy.ujf-grenoble.fr/Introduction-627?lang=en), working on microbial growth laws of resource allocation in changing environments, using a combination of Control Theory and Synthetic Biology.

Before that, I also worked in Theoretical Physics ([Goldstein lab](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/), University of Cambridge, UK) and Eco-Evolutionary Mathematics (with [Silvia de Monte](http://www.biologie.ens.fr/eceem/demonte.html), Ecole Normale Supérieure, FR) during several interships.

Overall, I am interested by many scientific subjects from Maths to Exobiology, but am also a space exploration enthusiast!
I am a free software and data privacy advocate, who likes rock climbing, bouldering, and mountain-related activities in general.
