I am currently a Postdoc at Laboratoire des Sciences du Numérique de Nantes (LS2N, CNRS UMR 6004)
working on eco-systems metabolic modeling of microbial communities using Tara Oceans data.

During my PhD thesis, I have worked on the fundamental laws governing microbial
life in dynamical environments using Control Theory and Synthetic Biology
techniques, as a Research and Teaching Assistant at
[Université Grenoble Alpes](http://www-liphy.ujf-grenoble.fr/Introduction-627?lang=en)
and [INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/ibis/).

My previous research projects were in Theoretical Physics
at [Goldstein lab](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/)
(University of Cambridge, UK) and Eco-Evolutionary Mathematics with
[Silvia de Monte](http://www.biologie.ens.fr/eceem/demonte.html)
(Ecole Normale Supérieure, FR).

I am mostly a Data and Modeling Scientist, but I also happened to spend a substantial amount
of time at the bench during my PhD Thesis.
Feel free to [contact me](./contact.html) if you think we share common research interests.
