I'm a research and teaching assistant in computational biology at Université Grenoble Alpes (France).
I'm currently writing my PhD thesis about my work in [project-team Ibis](https://team.inria.fr/ibis/) (Inria Grenoble - Rhône-Alpes)
and [team BIOP](http://www-liphy.ujf-grenoble.fr/Introduction-627?lang=en) (LIPhy).

My research interests focus on the fundamental laws of life.
During the last years, I became a full-stack biologist: I collect my own data at the bench and carry out the mathematical analysis (fluorescence data from reporter genes, microscopy...).
But I really look forward to the day when robots can do the bench part !

My previous research was on maths & theoretical physics (in Cambridge, UK) and eco-evolutionary maths (ENS, Paris).
Over the years, I acquired a taste for elegant equations, simple models, Linux and the Python programming language.

Besides, I believe in open science and post-publication peer-review, and am also an open-source advocate.
