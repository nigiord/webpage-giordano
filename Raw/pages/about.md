I am a Computational Systems Biologist specialized in the modeling and analysis of cell communities.

To get a quick overview of my work, you can find:

- example of code I wrote on github <a href="https://github.com/nigiord"><i class="fa fa-github-square fa-lg"></i></a>
or my employer's gitlab <a href="https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/giordano-n"><i class="fa fa-gitlab fa-lg"></i></a>, 
- research papers that I co-authored on the [research section](./research.html) of this website.

Since January 2023, I work as a Postdoc in the [Integrated Cancer Genomics](https://crci2na.univ-nantes.fr/en/research/team-8) team (ICAGEN) of the Nantes-Angers Cancer and Immunology Research Center (CRCI<sup>2</sup>NA).
I apply my modeling skills on the integration of single-cell multiomic datasets from [multiple myeloma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_myeloma) samples, a plasma cell cancer characterized by its huge heterogeneity across patients

This new project follows 4 years of postdoctoral experience studying ocean and gut microbial communities both in academia and the industry.
I have a widespread and validaded expertise on [NGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing) data analysis, [Metabolic Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_network_modelling), [Microbial Ecology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbial_ecology),
but also the application of [Control Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory) and [Synthetic Biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biology) to Cell Biology.
You will find more detailed information about my previous work on the [Research](./research.html) and [CV](./cv.html) sections of this website.

Overall, my scientific interests are at the interface of maths, biology, and computer sciences.
Apart from science, my favorite Linux distribution is [Debian Sid](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable) and my favorite keyboard layout is [BÉPO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%89PO).
I read fantasy novels (Markus Heitz, Robin Hobb, Andrzej Sapkowski, Terry Pratchett, ...) and watch videos about economics ([Heureka](https://www.youtube.com/c/HeurekaFinanceEco)).
I am also a free software and data privacy advocate.
I like rock climbing and bouldering which I practice around Nantes (it's where I live!).

Feel free to [contact me](./contact.html) with any questions about my work or inquiries about work opportunities.
