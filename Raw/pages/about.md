I'm a **computational biologist** currently looking for a Postdoctoral position
in the academic or the industrial sector on **synthetic biology** or **bioengineering**.

For the last years, I've been a research and teaching assistant at Université Grenoble Alpes (France).
On March, 23th 2017, I defended my PhD thesis about my work in
[project-team Ibis](https://team.inria.fr/ibis/) (Inria Grenoble - Rhône-Alpes)
and [team BIOP](http://www-liphy.ujf-grenoble.fr/Introduction-627?lang=en) (LIPhy).
I have worked on the fundamental laws governing microbial life in dynamical environments using tools
from **control theory** and **synthetic biology**.
One could say I'm a **full-stack biologist**, developing mathematical theories, collecting my own data at the bench,
and carrying out the mathematical analysis.
But I look forward for the day robots can do the bench part!

My previous research was on **maths & theoretical physics** in
[Goldstein lab](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/) (University of Cambridge, UK)
and **eco-evolutionary maths** with [Silvia de Monte](http://www.biologie.ens.fr/eceem/demonte.html) (Ecole Normale Supérieure, FR).
Over the years, I acquired a taste for elegant equations, simple models, Linux and the Python programming language.

Besides, I believe in open science and post-publication peer-review, and am also an open-source advocate.
