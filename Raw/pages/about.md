### Prospective Post-doc in Computational Biology, Synthetic Biology, Bioengineering

For the last years, I've been a research and teaching assistant in computational biology at Université Grenoble Alpes (France).
On March, 23th 2017, I defended my PhD thesis about my work in [project-team Ibis](https://team.inria.fr/ibis/) (Inria Grenoble - Rhône-Alpes)
and [team BIOP](http://www-liphy.ujf-grenoble.fr/Introduction-627?lang=en) (LIPhy). 
I'm currently looking for a Post-doc either in the academic or industrial sector in computational biology, synthetic biology or bioengineering.

My research interests focus on the fundamental laws governing microbial life, but also on their possible biotechnological applications.
During my PhD Thesis, I developped my own mathematical representations of the cell and worked as a full-stack biologist:
I collected my own data at the bench,
and carried out the mathematical analysis (fluorescence data from reporter genes, microscopy...).
But I really prefer when robots can do the bench part!

My previous research was on maths & theoretical physics (in Cambridge, UK) and eco-evolutionary maths (ENS, Paris).
Over the years, I acquired a taste for elegant equations, simple models, Linux and the Python programming language.
My philosophy is that mechanistic details are the worst enemy of the modeller, and that simple phenomenological models are
powerful tools to uncover the fundamental laws we need to understand biology.

Besides, I believe in open science and post-publication peer-review, and am also an open-source advocate.
